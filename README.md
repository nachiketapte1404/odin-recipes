Repository as a part of Odin Project foundations course

This repository was created as a part of learning in the Odin Foundations course
I have been yearning to learn html, css and javascript and found that Odin Project does the job for me.
This repo will contain certain recipes and will help me learn more about html , css and js

I have added three recipes which you will find in the recipes folder. They are:
1) Red sauce pasta
2) Bhendi Masala
3) Organic Taro Leaves (अळू भाजी)
