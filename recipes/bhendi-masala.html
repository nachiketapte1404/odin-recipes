    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>in Hindi language, okra or lady’s fingers is called ‘Bhindi’. The term ‘Masala’ in this preparation refers to a
        sautéed and cooked base of aromatics like onions, garlic, ginger with the usual tomatoes and a handful of Indian
        spices and herbs.<br />
        Thus the Bhindi Masala Recipe actually refers to okra made in a tangy and spiced masala base of onions,
        tomatoes, ground spices and herbs. The spice combination that I have used in this recipe is often added to many
        other recipes from the Punjabi cuisine.
        <br />Some years back, I had tried Bhindi Masala in a North Indian restaurant and it was super delightful, in
        fact fantastic! The flavors and texture of the dish just overpowered its simplicity.
        <br />This Bhindi Masala Recipe replicates the one that is served in restaurants. Some restaurants also serve a
        gravy version of this dish. But my recipe is that of a semi-dry one.
