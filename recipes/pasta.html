        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Red Sauce Pasta is a popular pasta variant made with a bright, tangy homemade tomato sauce. <br/>This tomato based sauce is usually made by sautéing onions & garlic in olive oil to which fresh or canned tomatoes or tomato puree is added.<br/>
            The ingredients are further cooked until the sauce thickens. This red sauce is later flavored with herbs like basil, parsley, thyme or oregano and spices like black pepper or red chilli flakes.</p>

                They should not be over cooked. </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2.5 cups water with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon oil in a pan until the water comes to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>Then, add 100 grams or 1 cup pasta.</li>
            <li>On medium to high heat, begin to cook the pasta.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta until al dente or you can opt to cook them until they are completely done.</li>
            <li>Then, strain the pasta using a colander or strainer.<br/>Keep aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><strong>Make Red Sauce</strong></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food chopper, food processor, mixer or blender, crush 2 large tomatoes (220 grams) to a puree.<br/>
                Keep aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pan, wok or kadai. Add 1 small to medium bay leaf<br/>
                or tej patta and 4 small to medium finely chopped garlic cloves.<br/>
                Sauté for some seconds or until the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic.</li>
            <li>Add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions</li>
            <li>Begin to sauté the onions on low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Sauté onions till translucent.</li>
            <li>Then, add the prepared tomato puree. If using store bought tomato puree, add 1 cup of it.</li>
            <li>Then, add the prepared tomato puree. If using store bought tomato puree, add 1 cup of it.</li>
            <li>Stir at intervals and sauté until you see the oil leaving the sides and the sauce has thickened a bit.<br/>
                This means that the tomato puree has cooked.</li>
            <li>Next, add 1.25 cups chopped button mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Mix very well.</li>
            <li>Sauté for 6 to 7 minutes on low to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Next, add ⅓ cup chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Mix well.</li>
            <li>Sauté the capsicum on low to medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes. <br/>
                By now the capsicum will be half cooked and the mushrooms will be cooked.</li>
            <li>Add ½ teaspoon sugar or as required.</li>
            <li> Then, add ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg powder and ¼ to ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Next, add salt as per taste. Mix very well.<br/>
                If using wine, then you can add 1 tablespoon white or red wine at this stage.<br/>
                Instead of wine, you can also add ½ tablespoon balsamic vinegar or red wine vinegar.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Make Red Sauce Pasta</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Now, add the steamed vegetables and ⅓ cup steamed sweet corn kernels in the sauce.</li>
            <li>Then, add the cooked pasta.</li>
            <li>Gently toss and mix everything very well, so that the red sauce coats the pasta as well as the vegetables. <br/>
                At this step, you can also add some cream or grated cheese.<br/>
                <em>After mixing if the pasta looks dry to you, add in a splash of water and mix thoroughly.</em></li>
            <li>Turn off the heat. Add 1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil leaves or your preferred herbs. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Serve Red Sauce Pasta hot or warm. This pasta tastes good even when served at room temperature.<br/><br/>
                While serving, you can garnish with some grated cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, processed or vegetarian parmesan) and <br/>
                fresh herbs like basil, parsley, cilantro and thyme.</li>
